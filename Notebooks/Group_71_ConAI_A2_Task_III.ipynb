    "- Choose a small open-source language model suitable for fine-tuning:\n",
    "- Examples: `DistilBERT, MiniLM, GPT-2 Small/Medium, Llama-2 7B, Falcon 7B, Mistral 7B`.\n",
    "- Ensure no use of closed or proprietary APIs.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3.3 Baseline Benchmarking (Pre-Fine-Tuning)\n",

    "3.4 Fine-Tuning\n",
    "- Fine-tune the selected model on your Q/A dataset.\n",
    "- Log all hyperparameters: Learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, compute setup (CPU/GPU).\n",

    "\n",
    "      - Increasing Q/A dataset size to `500-2000` high-quality, domain-specific pairs can lead in better generalization.\n",

    "      - To Include corrective training examples from past model mistakes to target weaknesses.\n",

    "      - To Provide richer context in prompts `(source + Q + A)` to strengthen factual grounding.\n",
    "    \n",
    "      - Need to Train for more epochs `(5-8)` with early stopping to avoid underfitting.\n",
    "    \n",
    "      - Lowering learning rate `(e.g. 2e-5)` to prevent catastrophic forgetting.\n",
    "            \n",
